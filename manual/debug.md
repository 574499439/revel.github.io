By default, the `revel run` without a [`run_mode`] default to `dev`.

## Hot Reload

As part of the development cycle, Revel can be configured to 'watch' for local file changes, and recompile as necessary.

- See the [`watchers`](appconf.html#watchers) in [`conf/appconf`](appconf.html)

## Debug using gdb

Go applications can be debugged using the [GNU Debugger (GDB)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/).

- See Go's [official guide](http://golang.org/doc/gdb)

- This [StackOverflow - Revel debugging HOWTO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23952886/revel-debugging-how-to) post 

The material below is a quick shortened version of the above and thanks ;-)

*Work in progress* and soon
